# Nuclear Distance Analysis

This Python script performs analysis on the distances between nucleus positions in microscopy images for control and experimental groups. It calculates pairwise distances, visualizes the data with histograms, scatter plots, and KDE plots, and conducts statistical tests to compare the groups.

## Features

- Annotation of nucleus positions on microscopy images.
- Calculation of pairwise distances between nucleus positions.
- Visualization of nucleus positions and distances.
- Statistical analysis including ANOVA, Tukey HSD test, effect size calculation, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Scipy
- Pandas
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Foysalgebt12/Nucleia-Distance
    ```

2. Install Python and required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script `Nucleia_Distance.py`:
    ```bash
    python Nucleia_Distance.py
    ```




Step 1: Install Python

If you haven't already installed Python on your system, you can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Install OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used for image processing. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

Step 3: Install Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

Step 4: Install NumPy

NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Step 5: Install SciPy

SciPy is a library for scientific computing and technical computing. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install scipy
```

Step 6: Install Pandas

Pandas is a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

Step 7: Install Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on Matplotlib. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install seaborn
```

Step 8: Clone the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository containing the code to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Foysalgebt12/Nucleia-Distance.git
```

Step 9: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Nucleia-Distance
```

Step 10: Run the Python Script

You can now run the Python script using the following command:

```bash
python Nucleia_Distance.py
```

You've installed all the necessary tools and dependencies and can now run the provided code successfully. Let me know if you need further assistance!
